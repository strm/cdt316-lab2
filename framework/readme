The assignment requires a nameserver to be running. The system 
can be configured both as stand-alone or as networked. 

If you are runnig a networked version (that will use a central namserver 
running on the IDt's webserver), you don't need to do anything,
because the system is already configured so as default (in other words, 
you can stop reading this file now).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Otherwise, if you wish to run the stand-alone version you'll need to 
reconfigure the system. If configured as stand-alone, you must 
start a nameserver on a local machine that you're working on. 
Besides, only one person can run the system on a given machine 
at the time.

Do the following to configure as stand-alone:

1. set NAMESERVER in nameserver.h to a machine that will run your
   local nameserver (e.g lab6-4.idt.mdh.se). (The computer name is
   either found on a tag on the computer case or can be retrieved
   by using the command 'uname -a'.)

2. run 'make clean'

3. run 'make'


Now when you're done with reconfiguring your system, you can try 
it out by doing the following:  

1. decide which database instance will be your local
   nameserver (e.g. DATABASE2)

2. start your nameserver by typing: 'dbserver nameserver DATABASE2 &'

3. start one database instance e.g: 'dbserver DATABASE1 &'

4. start the midleware: 'middle &'

5. run 'frontend 1 test.op'

You should get the result: 
10
20
and the middleware process should terminate automaticaly


Now you can try out that your nameserver works even if you log in 
to a different machine. Do the following:

1. log in to a differen machine, e.g. 'rlogin lab6-5.idt.mdh.se'
   (or use 'ssh lab6-5.idt.mdh.se' if rlogin doesn't work)

2. run annother middleware instance 'middle &' 
   (note that even this instance will connect to your DATABASE1 
   that you started on the first machine, because it's hardcoded in 
   middle.c to connect to DATABASE1)

3. run 'frontend 1 test.op'

Even this shoud work.
